there are only a couple of good colors
but every has a different opinion, a different color on the infinite spectrum

0001 => r0x02
0002 => r0x04
0004 => r0x08
0005 => r0x0F
0006 => r0xFF

0007 => no read after two writes, 0x0F

if we compare the 

9 pulses between the start and end sequences:
start: sda down, then sclk down
stop: sclk up, sda up

9 on rises: 8 bits MSB first, ack bit
011 000 000

no acknowledge bit?

beginTransmission to 0x50, endTransmission to 0x50
1010 0000 1 LOOK THERE IS AN ACK BIT!

/// UNO
communicating with a snap_test_uno that is writing back 0x0C (12)
r0x00 => 0006
r0x04 => 0007
r0xFF => 0008
r0x0F => 0009


for the r0x0f example, 3 frames, two on each end identical?

device is 7 bits:

frame 1 (beginTransmission to 0x8, the write(0x0F))
0001000 0              0     00001111        0
device  master writes  ack   0x0F            ack

frame 2 (slave responds)
0001000 1              0     00001100        1
device  master reads   ack   address (data)  ack
18 bits sent over        * this means slave responded 

frame 3 (endTransmission to 0x8, the write(0x0F))
0001000 0              0     00001111        0
device  master writes  ack   0x0F            ack
/// UNO

/// after bit-banging and learning sccb, hack i2c to fake it?
r0x04, on 0x30

phase 1: id
011 0000 0 0 0000 0100 0
  3    0 r a    0    4 a

phase 2:
011 0000 1 0 0010 0011 1 0
3      0 w a    2    3 w a

so this is 0x23 => 35

in sccb world what do these mean?

0110 0000 0 0000 0100 0
   6    0 x    0    4 x

so it just happens that i2c works with sccb


one thing we see is that between phases you can stop and restart transmission

YAY WE CAN WRITE AND READ FROM REGISTERS!!!

r0xFF
w0xFF,0x00
r0xFF

todo: should learn how to run i2c on 2 GPIO pins, and learn to big-bang it
